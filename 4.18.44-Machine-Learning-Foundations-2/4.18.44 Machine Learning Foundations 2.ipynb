    "### Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of regression that we've seen so far is called **simple linear regression**, because it studies the relationship between one dependent variable $y$ and one predictor variable $X$. Sometimes you may want to use several independent variables $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ to predict the response variable $y$, in such cases we talk about **multiple linear regression**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some **important assumptions** to be aware of when doing multiple regression: \n",
    "\n",
    "- there is a *linear relationship* between both the dependent and independent variables; \n",
    "- there is *no major correlation* between the independent variables. \n",
    "- other more technical assumptions are [listed here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Assumptions)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Model \n",
    "\n",
    "The general model for multiple linear regression is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... + b_px_p + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're now working with more than one independent variable, we will have a matrix of predictors $X$ (containing the $x_1, x_2, ... x_p$ feature vectors), a set of parameters $b = [b_0, b_1, b_2, ..., b_p]$ as well as one vector $y$ containing the response variable. The previous equation can be rewritten in the following algebraic formulation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    y = b^TX\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where: \n",
    "\n",
    "- $X$ is a $n \\times p$ matrix containing $n$ observations and $p$ predictors\n",
    "- $b$ is a vector of length $p$ containing the regression coefficients\n",
    "- $y$ is a vector containing the $n$ response values\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the set of estimated parameters $\\hat{b}$ that **minimise the sum of squared residuals** is given by the following equation:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\hat{b} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the complete derivation of the $\\hat{b}$ parameter estimate at [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Least-squares_estimation_and_related_techniques)."

    "We can easily do multiple regression with `statsmodels`, in fact we just need to specify a new $X$ object containing all the predictors we want to include. Let's use the same `penguins` example as before, but this time we want to predict the `body_mass_g` variable with the help of the following three independent variables: `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`."

    "Let's look closely at our results. A first **warning bell** comes from the R-squared statistic: it is now $R^2 = 0.76$ and, if you remember from our simple regression exercise, when we modelled the body mass using only the penguin's flipper length, we got an $R^2 = 0.759$. So this means that **adding two more predictors** helped increase the explained variation by only 0.001, which is to say, it **did not help improving the model at all**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, if we look at the **p-values of the regression coefficients**, we can clearly see that `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm` are not statistically significant (as the p-values are greater than the significance threshold $\\alpha = 0.05$). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you remember the \"Assumptions\" section, we said that the predictors should have a linear relationship with the dependent variable, but they should not be strongly correlated with each other. Let's produce a **correlation matrix** to investigate this assumption."

    "When evaluating a model (or comparing it to another one), it's always useful to choose a **performance (or accuracy) metric**. There are various accuracy metrics, depending on the type of model you're working with. One simple and popular metric for regression models is the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, which is the average of the absolute difference between the observed response variable $y$ and the predicted values $\\hat{y}$:\n",
